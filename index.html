            <p>I bring home the bacon as a web designer. My job is to facilitate online communication between brands and customers. A lot goes in to each finished product—research,  site architecture, wireframing, prototyping, user testing, and UX and visual design. These online experiences represent the best of my work.</p>

            <p>I believe golf takes hand-eye and color coordination. I believe in a quiet barber. I believe in country music, comfort zones, fitted ball caps, and a five-day forecast of rain. I believe summer is overrated and Christmas is just as the song suggests, the most wonderful time of the year. I believe in both sides of most debates.</p>
